How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
I didn't have to look through the entire document. The spots were the bug can be were selected for me.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
You can check each change separately. It helps you navigate your projects easily.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros is choosing the set of changes that logically go together by yourself. Corn is the situation when you forget to save important changes on time.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
The version control system is about working with the code, which includes several files related to each other and changes made in all of them at the same time, while Google Docs is aboout working with one file at a time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git log helps you find the commits to be compared. Git diff helps you find the charges between the selected commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Even if a bug appears, you can always easily find he change, which has caused it.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I would like to write some code, to create several commits, to see the git log, to make a bug, find it with comparing commits and fix it.
