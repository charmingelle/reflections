What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A new .git is being created in the current folder. The repository needs to be initiated to show that I would like to use Git options with a certain folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area includes the files you are about to commit. It can containg all the files in the working directory or a part of them. The repository is a set of commits while files in the staging area are just about to become a new commit. The staging area offers an opportunity to include changes in separate files in separate commits.
